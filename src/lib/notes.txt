Bot.mli:
- change difficulty parameter, make it more clear
- also clarify confidence parameter
  - dont need getters
- make "make move" more clear--wanna see what move the bot chooses
- action?
  - add attributes to actions, like which player is making the move
- illegal moves?
  - exceptions
- change bot.mli? reimplement? remove?

Card.mli:
  - @@deriving variants? (ppx variants)
  - write our own to_string function

Deck.mli:
  - hide type t
  - one canonical deck (there is a sorted deck, no unit argument)
  - draw card (needs to modify deck) (t -> C.t * t)
    - draw_card_exn
  - burn card (similar, t -> t)
    - burn_card_exn

Player.mli:
  - make "hand.mli"
    - dont call it hand lol
    - functions on sets of cards
    - whats the best 5-card hand out of 7
    - value of 5-card hand
  - make hole cards a tuple
    - list doesnt tell us what its structure is

Game.mli:
  - theres no "round" structure
  - tries to combine multiple things in one, too many things
  - break down in multiple pieces
  - don't wanna work with indices on lists
    - head of the list is current player? circular data structure
    - make order embedded in data structure
  - make community_cards its own type, make it constrained by betting round
    - make community_cards.mli module
  - chip count? make chip type, simply different from integer  
  - derive getters (don't need them) or project objects
  - rotate_players/current player index
    - need circular data structure, could make own?
  - pre_flop function (incredibly unclear whats going on with this function)
    - phantom type? (reference: comparison type in map)
    - round parameter? could be beneficial, could get in the way
    - big_blind_bet should only be able to be called during pre-flop
  - call, raise, fold are all just moves
  - end_game shouldn't return unit
  - poker is a bunch of people playing poker at a table--game should be a snapshot of the end results
    - table module?
    - betting_round doesn't care about hand number
  - modularize the round stuff in game
  - hand module? also differentiate from hand as in 2 hole cards, 5 community_cards
